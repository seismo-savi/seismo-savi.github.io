At the Seismological Society of America (SSA) topical fall meeting on [Physics-based Ground Motion Modeling](https://www.seismosoc.org/groundmotion-2/), I delivered a first overview of the effort to compile a database of ground motion records recorded by smartphones using the MyShake app. I presented on the importance of considering the effect of buildings, and how controlling for this effect can mean this dataset becomes very useful for getting details on free-field ground motion. I was also a panelist on a panel discussion on how to use unconventional and weak motion data to push model data ranges to aid model extrapolation.

The meeting chairs' summary of discussions has now been published in [Seismological Research Letters (SRL)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220240084).
