Hi everyone, welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am part of [Professor Richard Allen's](https://rallen.berkeley.edu/) real-time seismology and earthquake early warning group. As an earthquake seismologist, I principally work on understanding ground motion due to earthquakes using crowdsourced records from the [MyShake](https://myshake.berkeley.edu/) smartphone app, as well as creating workflows to analyze the performance of the West Coast earthquake early warning alert delivery pipeline. I am also very interested in characterizing seismic sources. You can head to the [Projects](https://seismo-savi.github.io/portfolio/) page to learn more.

Prior to joining UC Berkeley in August 2022, I completed an Integrated Masters (MSci) degree in Geophysics, at the [Department of Earth Science & Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) at Imperial College London. I assisted with various research projects as an undergraduate, on which you can find out more through the [Publications](https://seismo-savi.github.io/publications/) page.

I am also passionate about doing outreach on earthquake science - you can check out more details in my Outreach page (under construction)!

I am originally from the small Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where one of the world's best preserved Ophiolite sequences, the [Troodos Ophiolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodos_Ophiolite) is found. The Eastern Mediterranean region exhibits impressive tectonic complexity, so you will sometimes find me tweeting about it. Despite being a desk-based earth scientist, I love exploring the great outdoors.
