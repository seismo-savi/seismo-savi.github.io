Hi everyone, welcome to my website! I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am part of [Professor Richard Allen's](https://rallen.berkeley.edu/) real-time seismology and earthquake early warning group. As an earthquake seismologist, I principally work on understanding ground motion due to earthquakes using crowdsourced records from the [MyShake](https://myshake.berkeley.edu/) smartphone app, as well as creating workflows to analyze the performance of the West Coast earthquake early warning alert delivery pipeline. I am also very interested in characterizing seismic sources. You can head to the Projects page to learn more.

I am also passionate about doing outreach about earthquake science - you can check out more details in my Outreach page!
