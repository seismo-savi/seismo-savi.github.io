This work was led by Dr Sarina Patel at UC Berkeley Seismology Lab. I was responsible for carrying out the smartphone noise floor tests on the special base-isolated facility at Haviland Hall, while I also compiled the crowdsourced earthquake waveform database used to source data "from the wild" for SHM analysis.
